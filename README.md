# Project-outline

Project Description: My project will be a summarized report on how I believe Disney can improve its profits when it comes to Lucasfilm. I will start out by describing how Disney's current projects are a little out of touch with a big portion of the fan base. I will then give a step-by-step instruction list that will begin to help Disney move towards better projects that will help boost their profits. I will give a couple of examples of projects that I believe can help with this process. I will also give a few different methods on how they can make these projects to where it won't be overly expensive. I will also describe how these projects can reach these disillusioned fans

Problem Addressing: The problem I am looking to address is the fact that some Disney fans feel like they are not being given what they want. I have seen a few content creators on YouTube and on TikTok talk about how a lot of Disney projects feel mediocre at best. This causes a huge portion of the fans to be uninterested in new upcoming projects due to the fact that they are wary of a lot of the mediocre and terrible projects. Which in turn really affects Disney's profit margins when it comes to Lucasfilm. I will be addressing this problem by offering a few different project ideas that will help these disenfranchised fans regain their interest in Star wars.

Platform: Android Studios

Front/Back end support: This project will not really require any front or back-end support due to the fact that it will be a simplistic block of text with a clear concise message. It will consist of a list, a description, and projected financial earnings

Functionality: The functionality for this app will be if the app can open successfully and successfully display the message in the format that I type it up in.

Design: The design for this project will be relatively simple because my goal is to get the message across as clearly and concisely as possible and it is my personal belief that this sort of project should not have too much design to it because I feel like that would take away from the message that I am trying to get across.
